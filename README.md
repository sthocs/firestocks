# Firestocks - Follow all your stocks in Firefox with a single click

This Firefox extension will add a button to your Firefox toolbar.
When you click on it, it will open a simple popup displaying the latest info
about the stocks you follow.

Followed stocks are set in the extension's options page.

Stock data is refreshed each time you open the popup. 
Forex data is only from the day before and stored locally until next day (real-time APIs are paying).
